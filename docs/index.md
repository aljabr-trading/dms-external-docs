# Aljabr Dealer Management System API Documentation

Welcome to the **Dealer Management System (DMS) API Documentation**.  
This website is designed to help developers and integrators understand and interact with our API endpoints efficiently.

## Purpose of this API

The DMS API allows authorized systems to interact with our Dealer Management System programmatically.  
It is intended for use by partners, dealerships, and internal teams who need to integrate their applications with DMS data and processes.

With this API, you can:
